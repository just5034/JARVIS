# JARVIS — Project Instructions

## What Is JARVIS

JARVIS is a self-hosted, difficulty-aware inference system with specialist routing that serves as the reasoning backend for GRACE (a High Energy Physics research agent) and as a general-purpose LLM replacement for frontier API calls. It deploys a single strong base model behind an OpenAI-compatible API, augmented by inference amplification (best-of-N, verification, budget forcing), domain-specific LoRA adapters, and on-demand specialist models.

**JARVIS is a system, not a single model.** It wraps a unified base model (Qwen3.5-27B) in a difficulty-aware inference layer, with specialist routing for non-LLM domains (proteins, genomics) and HEP-specific LoRA adapters for domain expertise. The base model, adapters, and specialists can all be swapped independently.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Deployment target:** NVIDIA DGX Spark (128GB unified RAM, GB10 Blackwell, $4,699)
- **Unified base model:** Qwen3.5-27B (dense, 27B params, ~14 GB at FP4). Handles physics, math, code, and general queries. GPQA Diamond 86%, LiveCodeBench 80.7%, AIME 81%.
- **HEP adapters:** Two LoRA adapters (hep_physics, hep_code) hot-swapped when HEP content detected.
- **No separate math/physics/code brains.** Qwen3.5-27B exceeds all original per-domain targets. Domain classification still used for specialist dispatch, RAG activation, and HEP LoRA triggers.
- **Router:** Lightweight BERT classifier (~110M params), two-stage: domain → difficulty
- **Specialist models:** Standalone 7B models (ChemLLM, BioMistral, ESM3-open, Evo 2) loaded from SSD on demand
- **API format:** OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- **Inference framework:** vLLM or TensorRT-LLM on DGX Spark (CUDA/Blackwell native)
- **Quantization:** NVFP4 (native Blackwell support, <1% accuracy loss)

## HPC / SLURM Rules

- **SLURM account:** Always use `--account=bgde-delta-gpu` for ALL JARVIS jobs on Delta. No exceptions. This is the ONLY allocation for this project.
- **Python module:** `module load python/3.13.5-gcc13.3.1` (NOT anaconda3, which doesn't exist on Delta). System Python is 3.9 — too old.
- **Environments:** Use plain Python venv, not conda.

## Git & Commit Rules

- **No AI co-authorship lines.** Never add `Co-Authored-By` or any similar attribution to Claude, Anthropic, or any AI in commits.
- **No AI signatures or branding** in commit messages, PR descriptions, code comments, or any generated content.

## Development Principles

1. **Modular everything.** The base model, router, inference engine, and each specialist are independent components with clean interfaces. Adding a new specialist should require zero changes to existing code. Swapping the base model is a config change + LoRA retrain.

2. **Configuration-driven.** Model paths, LoRA adapters, inference settings, routing thresholds — all in YAML configs, not hardcoded. Swapping a brain or adding a domain is a config change.

3. **OpenAI-compatible API first.** GRACE (and any future client) talks to JARVIS through the standard OpenAI chat completions format. Internal routing is invisible to clients.

4. **Test against real benchmarks.** Every change must be evaluated against GPQA Diamond (physics), LiveCodeBench (code), and AIME 2024 (math). No vibes-based assessment.

5. **Memory-aware.** Every model loading decision must account for the 128GB RAM budget. The system should track active memory usage and swap models intelligently.

## Current Status

**Phases 0-6 complete (0-3 validated on Delta).** Full serving stack: vLLM inference, 8-domain router, difficulty-aware amplification (single_pass/best-of-N/verified), specialist loading with LRU eviction (ESM3/Evo2 adapters), RAG for physics queries (30-passage corpus). 142 tests passing. S* code execution verification implemented.

**Migration in progress (2026-04-01):** Pivoting from dual-base (R1-Distill-Qwen-32B + Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct) to single Qwen3.5-27B. Configs and docs updated. Next: cancel old SFT job, download Qwen3.5-27B to Delta, run baseline evals, simplify brain_manager.py and router code, verify inference pipeline compatibility (ThinkPRM, budget forcing), train HEP LoRA adapters.

**Phase 4A trace generation (old model) completed** — 5,000 traces archived. Phase 4B SFT job (17177608) pending cancellation — was training adapter for deprecated R1-Distill-Qwen-32B.

**Budget:** ~8,000 SUs total, ~76 SU spent. ~7,924 remaining for baseline evals, HEP LoRA training, and optional GRPO.
