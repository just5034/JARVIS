# JARVIS — Project Instructions

## What Is JARVIS

JARVIS is a self-hosted, routed multi-specialist AI system that serves as the reasoning backend for GRACE (a High Energy Physics research agent). It replaces expensive frontier API calls with a locally-deployed ensemble of specialist models behind an OpenAI-compatible API.

**JARVIS is NOT a single model or a Mixture of Experts.** It is a system — a query-level router dispatching to independent specialist brains, wrapped in an inference amplification layer, served via a unified API. Each brain can be swapped, upgraded, or extended independently.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Deployment target:** NVIDIA DGX Spark (128GB unified RAM, GB10 Blackwell, $4,699)
- **Physics brain base:** R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (Qwen2.5 architecture, 62.1% GPQA baseline, R1 reasoning distillation)
- **Code brain base:** Qwen3-32B (Qwen3 architecture, stronger code baseline for AZR self-play)
- **Two separate bases (~32 GB total at FP4).** Different architectures — LoRA adapters are NOT cross-compatible. Each brain loads its own base model.
- **Math brain:** R1-Distill-Llama-70B (off-shelf, no training) or R1-Distill-Qwen-32B with math LoRA (if memory-constrained)
- **Router:** Lightweight BERT classifier (~110M params), two-stage: domain → difficulty
- **Specialist models:** Standalone 7B models (ChemLLM, BioMistral, ESM3-open, Evo 2) loaded from SSD on demand
- **API format:** OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- **Inference framework:** vLLM or TensorRT-LLM on DGX Spark (CUDA/Blackwell native)
- **Quantization:** NVFP4 (native Blackwell support, <1% accuracy loss)

## Development Principles

1. **Modular everything.** Each brain, the router, the inference engine, and each specialist are independent components with clean interfaces. Adding a new specialist should require zero changes to existing code.

2. **Configuration-driven.** Model paths, LoRA adapters, inference settings, routing thresholds — all in YAML configs, not hardcoded. Swapping a brain or adding a domain is a config change.

3. **OpenAI-compatible API first.** GRACE (and any future client) talks to JARVIS through the standard OpenAI chat completions format. Internal routing is invisible to clients.

4. **Test against real benchmarks.** Every change must be evaluated against GPQA Diamond (physics), LiveCodeBench (code), and AIME 2024 (math). No vibes-based assessment.

5. **Memory-aware.** Every model loading decision must account for the 128GB RAM budget. The system should track active memory usage and swap models intelligently.

## Current Status

**Phase: Pre-development planning.** No code written yet. Training has not started. All documents in `docs/` describe the target system. Development will proceed in phases per `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
